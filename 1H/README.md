# 1H

Apart from this README, this is pretty much unchanged data folder we were given. 

Each subfolder contains data describing its own experiment. Raw spectrum is stored in a `.fid` file. NMRglue can read the whole folder and parse its contents to access both the signal and the metadata associated with it.

[Брутоформулы.txt](/1H/Брутоформулы.txt) (yes, it is misspelled slightly) file contains empirical formulas of the chemical compunds being analysed in each experiment.
